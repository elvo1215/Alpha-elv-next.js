# Alpha_elv — Rising from the Forest to the Future 🌍🔥

This is more than a Next.js project — it's a digital footprint from the hills of Kericho, Kenya. Built on a phone, in Termux, with faith, fire, and raw ambition. Alpha_elv is the beginning of a journey — from self-taught code to global impact.

## 🚀 What This Project Is

A blazing-fast, responsive web app built with:
- **Next.js 16** — for server-side rendering and performance
- **Tailwind CSS** — for clean, modern styling
- **TypeScript** — for type safety and scalability

## 🌱 The Mission

> “From the forest to the future.”  
> This project is a symbol of what’s possible when you mix code with courage.  
> I built this to show that no matter where you start, your story can go global.
